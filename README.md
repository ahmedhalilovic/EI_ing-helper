## Features

### **1. Cross Section Selection**
- Select cable cross-sections based on current or power requirements.
- Supports both copper and aluminum cables.
- Displays fuse selection recommendations.

### **2. Electrical Table**
- Provides a reference table with cable ampacities and suitable fuses.
- Organized for easy lookup of electrical parameters.

### **3. Voltage Drop Calculation**
- Calculates voltage drop based on input parameters such as power, power factor, voltage, cable length, and cross-section.
- Supports both copper and aluminum cables with predefined conductivity values.
- Displays the maximum cable length allowed to maintain a specified voltage drop.

### **4. Settings**
- Supports multilingual options (currently English and Bosanski).
- Provides additional tools such as a Compensation Calculator.
- Displays app version and details.

## How It Works
1. Enter power (kW), power factor, voltage, cable length, and cross-section.
2. Select the conductor material (copper or aluminum).
3. Tap **Calculate** to compute voltage drop and maximum allowable cable length.
4. Use the **Table** section for quick reference on cable capacities.
5. Customize settings, including language selection, in the **Settings** tab.

## Platform Support
- **iOS:** Built using Swift (UIKit-based UI).
- **Android:** Developed with Flutter (Dart).
- UI design remains consistent across both platforms.

## Installation
1. **iOS:** Download the app via TestFlight or install it directly from Xcode.
2. **Android:** Install the APK manually or download it from the Play Store (coming soon).

## Screenshots
_Add relevant images of the appâ€™s UI for reference._

## Roadmap
- Implement additional electrical calculations.
- Expand language support.
- Improve UI/UX for better usability.
